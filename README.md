Current project: Recreate a website (Google)

Things that I learned:
- How to use Visual Studio Code for HTML- this was my first project

Skills demonstrated:
- Basic knowledge of CSS/HTML
- How to use divs, classes, ids, buttons, etc.

What I need to work on:
- Best practices. I used ids/clases interchangably- need to fix this
- Growing my knowledge of CSS/HTML. I had to use Google a lot
- Accesibility. In this project, I did nothing to improve accessibility for others.
- Use of divs/replacements. I tended to ONLY use divs, I need to use the correct containers when necessary
- Googling effectively
